## REHAB-HFpEF-simulated-power-analysis
Code for simulating data for power analysis for identifying effect measure modifier (EMM) proteins.

## REHAB-HFpEF_eda.R 
R script developed to explore pilot data and approximate distribution of protein expression levels.

## REHAB-HFpEF_simulatedpoweranalysis.R
R script developed to simulate multiple datasets mimicing the properties of the pilot data, use the LASSO with quasi-Poisson responses to estimate model parameters and identify EMM proteins, and record power and false discovery proportions.

## Visualizations folder
Contains all visualizations produced by the above R scripts.
